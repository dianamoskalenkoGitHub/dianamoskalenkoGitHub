- 👋 Hi, I’m @dianamoskalenkoGitHub
- 👀 I am 37 years old, and I have been a translator from English into Russian pretty much my entire life. I have had a baby this year and thought I needed some change in my life. I have 0 exp in CS, this is scary, but we will see what comes next.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science out of curiosity and to distract myself from baby-sitting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... if anyone will be generous enough to collaborate on anything with me, I would be happy. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... dianas7@inbox.ru
